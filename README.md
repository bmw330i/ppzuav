# Paparazzi Next-Gen UAV System

## Overview

Paparazzi Next-Gen is a modernized version of the open-source Paparazzi UAV system, rebuilt from the ground up to eliminate OCaml dependencies and embrace autonomous flight with LLM-assisted mission management. This fork maintains full compatibility with existing ARM7 and STM32-based autopilot hardware while providing a cutting-edge Node.js and web-based ground control system.

**üéØ Key Innovation**: Integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, enabling intelligent mission planning, real-time atmospheric analysis, and autonomous decision-making for scientific research flights.

# Load example mission
npm run load-mission examples/microjet_demo.json
```


Directories quick and dirty description:
----------------------------------------

_conf_: the configuration directory (airframe, radio, ... descriptions).

_data_: where to put read-only data (e.g. maps, terrain elevation files, icons)

_doc_: documentation (diagrams, manual source files, ...)

_sw_: software (onboard, ground station, simulation, ...)

_var_: products of compilation, cache for the map tiles, ...


Compilation and demo simulation
-------------------------------

1. type "make" in the top directory to compile all the libraries and tools.

2. "./paparazzi" to run the Paparazzi Center

3. Select the "Microjet" aircraft in the upper-left A/C combo box.
  Select "sim" from upper-middle "target" combo box. Click "Build".
  When the compilation is finished, select "Simulation" from
  the upper-right session combo box and click "Execute".

4. In the GCS, wait about 10s for the aircraft to be in the "Holding point" navigation block.
  Switch to the "Takeoff" block (lower-left blue airway button in the strip).
  Takeoff with the green launch button.

Uploading of the embedded software
----------------------------------

1. Power the flight controller board while it is connected to the PC with the USB cable.

2. From the Paparazzi center, select the "ap" target, and click "Upload".


Flight
