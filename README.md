## üöÄ Quick Start (macOS M4)

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Node.js (v18+)
brew install node

# Install development tools
brew install git cmake

# Install ARM toolchain for autopilot firmware
brew install --cask gcc-arm-embedded
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bmw330i/paparazzi.git
cd paparazzi

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the system
npm run build

# Start the ground control station
npm run gcs
```

### First Flight Simulation
```bash
# Start the simulator
npm run sim

# Open GCS in browser
open http://localhost:3000

# Load example mission
npm run load-mission examples/microjet_demo.json
```


## üì° System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture prioritizing flight safety:

```
1. Flight Control Core (C on STM32/ARM7) - ALWAYS MAINTAINS AIRCRAFT CONTROL
2. Navigation System - Waypoint following and obstacle avoidance  
3. Mission Management - High-level autonomous goal execution
4. Ground Station - Monitoring, telemetry, mission updates
5. LLM Assistant - Advisory suggestions, mission optimization
```

**Safety Principle**: The LLM can NEVER directly control flight surfaces or override safety protocols. It provides intelligent suggestions that are validated against flight envelopes and safety constraints.

## üí¨ LLM Chat Interface

The integrated LLM provides natural language interaction for mission management:

```
Human: "Plan a temperature survey mission at 150m altitude covering the valley"

LLM: "I'll create a survey pattern with 8 waypoints covering the valley area at 150m. 
Based on current wind conditions (8kt from SW), I recommend starting from the 
downwind side to optimize fuel efficiency. Estimated flight time: 28 minutes."
```
