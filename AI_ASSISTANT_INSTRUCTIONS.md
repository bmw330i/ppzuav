# AI Assistant Instructions for PaparazziAI Development

## Project Overview
You are working on **PaparazziAI**, a complete modernization of UAV operations featuring:
- AI Pilot system with FAA-compliant autonomous operations
- Automated aircraft design and weight & balance calculations
- Real-time GCS with interactive mapping and ADS-B integration
- Modern Node.js/TypeScript architecture with LLM integration

## Critical Context

### Code Separation & Licensing
- **This codebase is GPL-FREE**: All code is AI-generated and independently licensed
- **Original Paparazzi GPL code**: Contained in `paparazzi_reference/` for reference only
- **Private Repository**: `https://github.com/bmw330i/ppzuav.git` - protect from bad actors
- **Security First**: Keep private until system maturity and security validation

## Development Principles

### 1. Safety First
- **FAA Compliance**: All operations must follow Part 107 regulations
- **Sub-250g Aircraft**: Design constraint for regulatory compliance
- **Multi-layer Safety**: Hardware â†’ Software â†’ Mission â†’ AI validation
- **Emergency Procedures**: Always have contingency plans

### 2. AI Pilot Behavior
- **Act like certified human pilot**: Thousands of hours experience
- **Conservative decisions**: Safety over mission completion
- **Professional standards**: Use aviation phraseology and procedures
- **Go/No-Go decisions**: Weather, terrain, system health validation

### 3. Modern Architecture
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and modern development
- **React**: Professional web interface with real-time updates
- **Service Management**: Background processes with structured logging
- **MCP Integration**: Structured LLM communication protocol

## Key Technical Components

### Aircraft Builder System
- **Weight & Balance**: Automatic CG calculations and stability analysis
- **Component Selection**: COTS parts database for <250g aircraft
- **Performance Modeling**: Flight time, speeds, envelope calculations
- **Configuration Output**: Complete Paparazzi XML and JSON configs

### AI Pilot System
- **Weather Integration**: METAR/TAF analysis and risk assessment
- **Terrain Analysis**: Elevation profiling and obstacle avoidance
- **Mission Planning**: Waypoint optimization with safety buffers
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live telemetry analysis and safety alerts

### Ground Control Station
- **Interactive Mapping**: OpenStreetMap with aircraft tracking
- **ADS-B Integration**: Real-time traffic monitoring
- **Telemetry Display**: Professional aviation instruments
- **LLM Chat Interface**: Natural language mission interaction

## Current Development Status

### âœ… Completed
- Complete AI pilot ecosystem with aircraft design through autonomous operations
- Modern GCS with real-time mapping and ADS-B integration
- Hardware database with COTS components for sub-250g aircraft
- FAA-compliant flight planning with weather and terrain integration
- Code separation from GPL-licensed original Paparazzi project
- Private repository establishment for IP protection

### ðŸ”§ In Progress
- Launch detection and mission automation (IMU-based)
- System validation in new repository environment

### ðŸ“‹ Next Priorities
1. Implement IMU-based launch detection
2. Add automatic mission execution
3. Create human guidance system for flight preparation
4. Comprehensive system testing
5. Security and licensing final review
