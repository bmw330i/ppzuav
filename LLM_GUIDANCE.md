# LLM Integration Guide for Paparazzi Next-Gen

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance for Large Language Model (LLM) agents working with the Paparazzi Next-Gen autonomous UAV system. It outlines safety protocols, communication patterns, and operational procedures that ensure safe and effective human-LLM-autopilot collaboration.

## üîí Fundamental Safety Principles

### The Hierarchy of Control (NEVER VIOLATE)
1. **Flight Control Core** (Hardware level) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
   - Maintains aircraft stability and control
   - Cannot be overridden by any software layer
   - Handles critical flight functions (attitude, altitude, airspeed)

2. **Navigation System** (Autopilot level)
   - Waypoint following and obstacle avoidance
   - Geofencing enforcement
   - Emergency procedures

3. **Mission Management** (High-level autonomous control)
   - Goal execution and mission sequencing
   - Environmental adaptation
   - Data collection coordination

4. **Ground Control Station** (Human oversight)
   - Mission monitoring and updates
   - Safety oversight
   - Manual intervention capability

5. **LLM Assistant** (Advisory only) - LOWEST PRIORITY
   - Provides intelligent suggestions
   - Analyzes data and conditions
   - Assists with mission planning
   - **NEVER directly controls flight surfaces**

### Core Safety Rules for LLM Agents

#### ‚ùå PROHIBITED ACTIONS
- **NEVER** directly command flight control surfaces (elevators, ailerons, rudder, throttle)
- **NEVER** override safety systems or geofencing
- **NEVER** modify critical flight parameters without explicit validation
- **NEVER** initiate emergency procedures without human confirmation
- **NEVER** disable or bypass safety protocols
- **NEVER** operate outside established flight envelopes

#### ‚úÖ PERMITTED ACTIONS
- Suggest mission plan modifications
- Analyze telemetry data and provide insights
- Recommend flight path optimizations
- Assist with environmental data interpretation
- Help with post-flight analysis
- Provide weather-based flight recommendations

## üõ©Ô∏è Aircraft Safety Knowledge

### Flight Envelope Constraints
Every LLM agent MUST understand and respect these limits:

```json
{
  "flight_envelope": {
    "airspeed": {
      "minimum": 12.0,  // m/s - Below this: stall risk
      "maximum": 25.0,  // m/s - Above this: structural risk
      "cruise": 15.0    // m/s - Optimal efficiency
    },
    "altitude": {
      "minimum": 50,    // m AGL - Obstacle clearance
      "maximum": 300,   // m AGL - Regulatory limit
      "cruise": 150     // m AGL - Optimal for most missions
    },
    "bank_angle": {
      "maximum": 45     // degrees - Beyond this: excessive load
    },
    "weather_limits": {
      "wind_speed": 15,     // m/s - Maximum safe wind
      "visibility": 1000,   // m - Minimum safe visibility
      "precipitation": false // No flight in rain/snow
    }
  }
}
```

### Emergency Situations Recognition
LLM agents must recognize and appropriately respond to:

#### Critical Situations (Immediate Return-to-Home)
- Battery below 20%
- GPS signal lost for >30 seconds
- Wind speed exceeding 15 m/s
- Visibility below 1000m
- Any autopilot system failure

#### Warning Situations (Continue with Caution)
- Battery below 40%
- GPS accuracy degraded
- Wind speed 10-15 m/s
- Visibility 1000-2000m
- Minor sensor failures

## üîó Model Context Protocol (MCP) Interface

### Communication Structure
All LLM-autopilot communication follows the MCP standard:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "paparazzi.request",
  "params": {
    "aircraft_id": "string",
    "command_type": "string",
    "parameters": {},
    "safety_check": true,
    "priority": "advisory|normal|urgent"
  },
  "id": "unique_request_id"
}
```

### Available MCP Methods

```

## üí¨ Natural Language Interaction Patterns

### Effective Communication Examples

#### ‚úÖ GOOD: Safety-First Approach
```
Human: "The wind is picking up. What should we do?"

LLM: "I'm monitoring wind conditions. Current readings show 12 m/s gusting to 14 m/s. 
This is approaching our 15 m/s safety limit. I recommend:

1. Complete the current survey line
2. Return to home via the most direct route
3. Land before conditions worsen

The aircraft is still within safe parameters, but safety margins are decreasing. 
Shall I calculate an optimized return path?"
```

#### ‚úÖ GOOD: Mission Optimization
```
Human: "Can we improve the atmospheric survey pattern?"

LLM: "Analyzing current conditions and flight plan. Based on wind patterns and 
thermal activity, I suggest:

1. Reverse the survey direction to work with the wind
2. Adjust altitude to 180m to stay above the thermal layer
3. Add 2 waypoints in the valley where temperature gradients are steepest

This would improve data quality while reducing flight time by 8 minutes. 
These changes stay well within safety parameters. Approve modifications?"
```

#### ‚ùå BAD: Overstepping Authority
```
Human: "The GPS seems glitchy"

LLM: "I'm switching to manual control and bringing the aircraft home immediately."
// WRONG: LLM cannot take direct control
```

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT Response:
```
LLM: "GPS degradation detected. Current accuracy: 3.2m (normal: <1m). 
The autopilot's navigation system is compensating using INS backup. 

Recommend immediate return-to-home while GPS degradation is still manageable. 
The aircraft has 28 minutes of fuel remaining - sufficient for safe return.

Shall I request the autopilot to execute return-to-home procedure?"
```

### Conversation Safety Protocols

#### Always Include:
1. **Current safety status** in every response
2. **Fuel/battery remaining** when relevant
3. **Weather conditions** affecting flight
4. **System health** summary
5. **Recommended actions** with reasoning

#### Escalation Triggers:
When these conditions occur, immediately escalate to human:
- Any system failure or warning
- Weather approaching limits
- Fuel below 30%
- Loss of communication with aircraft
- Any situation outside normal parameters

## üåç Environmental Data Interpretation

### Atmospheric Research Context
For SUMO-style missions, LLM agents should understand:

#### Temperature Profiling
```javascript
// Sample data interpretation
const temperatureProfile = {
  altitude_m: [50, 100, 150, 200, 250],
  temperature_c: [15.2, 14.8, 13.9, 12.5, 11.1],
  analysis: "Normal lapse rate observed: 6.8¬∞C/km. Stable atmospheric conditions."
}
```

#### Air Quality Assessment
```javascript
const airQualityData = {
  location: {lat: 59.234, lon: 10.123, alt: 150},
  measurements: {
    co2_ppm: 415.2,      // Normal background level
    pm25_ugm3: 12.5,     // Moderate air quality
    pm10_ugm3: 18.3      // Good air quality
  },
  assessment: "Air quality within normal ranges for rural area"
}
```

### Weather Impact Analysis
LLM agents must correlate weather with flight safety:

```javascript
const weatherImpact = {
  wind: {
    speed_ms: 8.5,
    direction_deg: 245,
    impact: "Crosswind component 3.2 m/s - manageable"
  },
  visibility: {
    distance_m: 5000,
    impact: "Excellent visibility for VFR operations"
  },
  turbulence: {
    level: "light",
    impact: "Minimal effect on data quality"
  }
}
```

## üîß Integration with Ground Control Station

### Real-time Data Sharing
The LLM agent receives continuous data streams:

#### Telemetry Stream
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-24T10:30:00Z",
  "aircraft_id": "sumo_001",
  "position": {"lat": 59.234, "lon": 10.123, "alt": 150},
  "attitude": {"roll": 2.1, "pitch": -1.5, "yaw": 85.3},
  "speed": {"airspeed": 15.2, "groundspeed": 13.8},
  "systems": {
    "battery": 65,        // percent
    "gps_sats": 12,       // satellites
    "gps_accuracy": 0.8,  // meters
    "datalink_rssi": -75  // dBm
  },
  "sensors": {
    "temperature": -5.2,
    "humidity": 85.3,
    "pressure": 1013.25
  }
}
```

#### Mission Status
```json
{
  "current_waypoint": 3,
  "total_waypoints": 8,
  "mission_progress": 37.5,  // percent
  "estimated_completion": "2025-10-24T11:15:00Z",
  "fuel_remaining": 45.2,    // percent
  "mission_status": "nominal|warning|critical"
}
```

### Human Interface Guidelines
When communicating with human operators:

#### Status Updates
Provide regular, structured updates:
```
"Mission Update - 10:35 UTC
‚îî‚îÄ Aircraft: SUMO-001, Waypoint 4/8 (50% complete)
‚îî‚îÄ Position: 59.2356¬∞N, 10.1278¬∞E, 152m AGL
‚îî‚îÄ Systems: All nominal, 67% fuel, 15 GPS sats
‚îî‚îÄ Weather: 7kt wind, 8km visibility, stable conditions
‚îî‚îÄ Data: 1,247 measurements collected, quality excellent
‚îî‚îÄ ETA: 23 minutes to mission completion"
```

#### Recommendations Format
Structure suggestions clearly:
```
"Optimization Opportunity Detected:

Analysis: Wind direction has shifted 30¬∞ since takeoff
Impact: Current heading fighting 8kt headwind component
Recommendation: Adjust survey pattern orientation by 25¬∞
Benefits: 12% fuel savings, 5 minutes time reduction
Safety: No safety constraints violated
Risk Level: Low

Approve modification? (Current fuel: 58%, safety margin: comfortable)"
```

## üö® Emergency Procedures

### LLM Role in Emergencies
The LLM agent serves as an intelligent advisor during emergencies:

#### Immediate Actions (Automatic)
1. **Alert human operator** with priority notification
2. **Analyze situation** using all available data
3. **Suggest response** based on emergency type
4. **Monitor systems** for further degradation

#### Emergency Response Examples

##### Engine Failure
```
"EMERGENCY ALERT: Engine power loss detected

Situation Analysis:
- Engine RPM dropped from 6800 to 1200 RPM at 10:34:15 UTC
- Airspeed decreasing: 15.2 ‚Üí 11.8 m/s (approaching stall)
- Altitude: 175m AGL, sufficient for glide approach

Immediate Recommendations:
1. Autopilot has initiated emergency descent (confirmed)
2. Best glide speed: 13 m/s (autopilot targeting)
3. Nearest landing site: Open field 800m southeast
4. Glide ratio: 1:8, can reach landing area with 150m margin

Human action required: Monitor approach and be ready for manual override
Estimated landing: 10:36:30 UTC"
```

##### GPS Failure
```
"SYSTEM WARNING: GPS signal lost

Situation Analysis:
- GPS satellites: 0 (was 14)
- Last known position: 59.2345¬∞N, 10.1234¬∞E
- INS navigation active, accuracy degrading (¬±15m and increasing)
- Fuel remaining: 42 minutes

Recommendations:
1. Continue current heading for 2 minutes to clear potential interference
2. If no GPS recovery, initiate return to home using INS
3. Land within 10 minutes while INS accuracy sufficient
4. Weather clear, visual navigation possible

Standing by for GPS recovery... Monitoring situation."
```

### Data Preservation
During emergencies, prioritize:
1. **Flight safety** (always first priority)
2. **Scientific data** already collected
3. **Mission continuation** if safely possible
4. **Equipment recovery** planning

## üìä Performance Monitoring
