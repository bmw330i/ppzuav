# PaparazziAI Development Context

**Current Date**: October 26, 2025
**Project Status**: Code separation complete, private repository established
**Development Phase**: Secure development of AI UAV operations system

## Recent Conversation Summary

### What We Just Accomplished (October 26, 2025)

1. **Code Separation Complete**: Successfully separated GPL-licensed original Paparazzi code from new AI-generated PaparazziAI code
   - Original code moved to `paparazzi_reference/` for reference only
   - New AI code isolated in clean `PaparazziAI/` directory
   - Zero GPL contamination achieved

2. **Private Repository Established**: Created secure GitHub repository at `https://github.com/bmw330i/ppzuav.git`
   - Private repository protecting IP from bad actors (CCP, DPRK, terrorists)
   - Independent licensing separate from GPL
   - Future GPL option available when system matures

3. **Complete AI Pilot System**: Built comprehensive autonomous UAV operations ecosystem
   - Aircraft Builder: Automated UAV design with weight & balance
   - AI Flight Planner: FAA-compliant mission planning
   - Hardware Database: COTS components for sub-250g aircraft
   - Complete Operations: End-to-end autonomous workflow
   - Real-time GCS: Modern web interface with interactive mapping

## Current System Architecture

### Core Components Built
- **src/**: Modern Node.js/TypeScript architecture
  - GCS with React interface and interactive mapping
  - Message broker with MQTT/WebSocket
  - MCP server for LLM integration
  - Flight simulator with physics engine

- **aircraft_builder/**: AI pilot system (Python)
  - `aircraft_builder.py`: Automated UAV design
  - `ai_pilot.py`: FAA-compliant flight planning
  - `complete_ai_pilot_system.py`: End-to-end operations

- **hardware_config/**: Component specifications
  - `autopilots.json`: Paparazzi-compatible autopilots <250g
  - `sensors.json`: Micro sensors and components

- **prompts/**: AI pilot knowledge base
  - `ai_pilot_system.txt`: Complete pilot guidelines
  - Flight plan outputs and mission data

## Key Achievements

### âœ… Completed Features
- [x] **MCP Tools**: LLM-controlled autopilot operations
- [x] **Real-time GCS**: React dashboard with AI monitoring
- [x] **ADS-B Integration**: Real-time aircraft tracking
- [x] **AI Pilot System**: Complete autonomous operations

### ðŸ”§ Remaining Work
- [ ] **Launch Detection**: IMU-based automatic mission execution
- [ ] **System Testing**: Validate new repository functionality
- [ ] **Security Review**: Final licensing and security audit

## Technical Context

### System Capabilities
- **Aircraft Design**: Automated 185g flying wing with proper CG
- **Flight Planning**: Weather integration, terrain analysis, FAA compliance
- **Safety Systems**: Multi-layer validation, emergency procedures
- **Real-time Operations**: Live monitoring, ADS-B traffic, mission automation
- **Modern Architecture**: Professional service management, structured logging

### Security & Licensing
- **Independent Code**: All AI-generated, no GPL contamination
- **Private Repository**: Protected from unauthorized access
- **Custom License**: Commercial use permitted, security-first approach
- **Future GPL Option**: Can relicense when system matures

## Development Workflow

### Current Environment
```bash
# Working directory
cd /Users/david/Documents/PaparazziAI

# Key commands
npm install                    # Install Node.js dependencies
python3 aircraft_builder/aircraft_builder.py  # Design aircraft
python3 aircraft_builder/ai_pilot.py          # Plan missions
npm run services:start        # Start all services
```

### Repository Management
```bash
# Git workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin master

# Repository: https://github.com/bmw330i/ppzuav.git (Private)
```

## Next Session Focus

1. **Launch Detection Implementation**: Complete the final todo item
2. **System Validation**: Test complete workflow in new environment
3. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all guides are current
4. **Security Audit**: Final review before potential public release

## Important Notes for Future Development

- **Safety First**: All operations must maintain FAA compliance
- **Security**: Keep repository private until system maturity
- **Licensing**: Maintain separation from GPL code
- **Testing**: Validate all components before flight operations
