# Launch Detection and Mission Automation Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of IMU-based launch detection and automatic mission execution for the PaparazziAI system. This is the final major component needed to complete the autonomous UAV operations ecosystem.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. IMU-Based Launch Detection

**Objective**: Detect aircraft launch automatically using IMU sensor data

**Implementation Strategy**:
- Monitor accelerometer data for launch signature
- Detect rapid acceleration indicating takeoff
- Differentiate between launch and handling/transport
- Trigger autonomous mission execution upon confirmed launch

**Key Parameters**:
- Acceleration threshold: > 2G sustained for > 0.5 seconds
- Gyroscope stability: Confirm aircraft attitude control
- GPS speed validation: Confirm forward motion > 5 m/s
- Safety timeout: 10-second confirmation window

### 2. Automatic Mission Execution

**Objective**: Execute pre-loaded mission automatically after launch detection

**Workflow**:
1. Pre-flight: Load mission plan and verify aircraft systems
2. Launch Detection: Monitor IMU for launch signature
3. Transition: Switch from manual to autonomous control
4. Mission Execution: Follow waypoints with real-time optimization
5. Safety Monitoring: Continuous system health and emergency procedures

### 3. Human Guidance System

**Objective**: Provide clear checklist and guidance for flight preparation

**Components**:
- Pre-flight checklist with system validation
- Launch preparation steps and safety checks
- Real-time status display and confirmation prompts
- Emergency abort procedures and safety overrides

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Launch Detection Algorithm

**File**: `src/flight-control/launch-detector.ts`

```typescript
interface LaunchDetectionConfig {
  accelerationThreshold: number;    // G-force threshold
  sustainedDuration: number;        // Minimum duration (ms)
  gyroStabilityThreshold: number;   // Angular velocity limit
  gpsSpeedThreshold: number;        // Minimum ground speed (m/s)
  confirmationWindow: number;       // Safety timeout (ms)
}

class LaunchDetector {
  // Monitor IMU data for launch signature
  // Validate with GPS and other sensors
  // Trigger mission execution when confirmed
}
```

**Integration Points**:
- Message broker for sensor data input
- AI pilot system for mission trigger
- GCS for status display and manual override

### Phase 2: Mission Automation

**File**: `aircraft_builder/mission_executor.py`

```python
class MissionExecutor:
    def __init__(self, flight_plan, safety_monitor):
        # Initialize with validated flight plan
        # Setup safety monitoring and emergency procedures
        
    def execute_autonomous_mission(self):
        # Execute waypoint navigation
        # Monitor system health continuously
        # Adapt to changing conditions
        # Handle emergency situations
```

**Safety Features**:
- Continuous system health monitoring
- Weather condition adaptation
- Emergency return-to-home procedures
- Manual override capability

### Phase 3: Human Guidance Interface

**File**: `src/gcs/src/components/FlightPreparation.tsx`

```typescript
interface FlightPreparationProps {
  aircraft: AircraftConfig;
  mission: FlightPlan;
  systemStatus: SystemHealth;
}

const FlightPreparation: React.FC<FlightPreparationProps> = () => {
  // Pre-flight checklist interface
  // System status validation
  // Launch preparation guidance
  // Emergency procedures display
};
```

**Checklist Items**:
- Aircraft configuration validation
- Weather conditions assessment
- Mission plan verification
- System health confirmation
- Emergency procedure briefing

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
IMU Sensors → Launch Detector → Mission Trigger → Autonomous Execution
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
GPS/Sensors → Validation → AI Pilot → Waypoint Navigation
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
System Health → Safety Monitor → GCS Display → Human Override
```
